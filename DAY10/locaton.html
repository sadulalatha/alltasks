   <center><h1>BIRLA MANDIR</h1></center>
   <p>Birla Mandir is a Hindu temple built on a 280 feet (85 m) high hillock called Naubath Pahad on a 13 acres (53,000 m2) plot 
    in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. The construction took ten years and was opened in 1976 by Swami Ranganathananda of 
    Ramakrishna Mission. The temple was constructed by the Birla Foundation, which has also constructed several similar temples 
    across India, all known as Birla Mandir.

    <h3>Architecture</h3>
    
    The temple manifests a blend of Dravidian, Rajasthani and Utkala architectures. It is constructed of 2000 tons of pure white marble.
    The granite idol of presiding deity Lord Venkateswara is about 11 ft (3.4 m) tall, and a carved lotus forms an umbrella on the top.
    A brass flagstaff in the temple premises rises to a height of 42 ft. (13 m). The temple does not have traditional bells, as 
    Swami Ranganathananda wished that the temple atmosphere should be conducive to meditation.
